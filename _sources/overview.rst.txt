Overview

.. _Graphite: https://github.com/graphite-project

Moira is a real-time alerting tool, based on Graphite_ data.


Key Features

.. _carbonapi: https://github.com/go-graphite/carbonapi/blob/ccac7217894801a5a6ceb8602a70ea0d79e975cf/cmd/carbonapi/COMPATIBILITY.md#functions
.. _govaluate: https://github.com/Knetic/govaluate/blob/master/MANUAL.md

* **Graphite storage independence**

  Some Graphite queries are *very* ineffective. Tools like Seyren_
  multiply this effect every minute making lots of ineffective queries
  and overloading your cluster. Moira relies on the incoming
  metric stream, and has its own fast cache for recent data.

* **Support for (almost) all Graphite functions**

  Graphite function library (carbonapi_) is embedded directly into
  Moira source code. You can use any function and get predictable results,
  like in your Graphite or Grafana dashboards.

* **Support for custom expressions**

  If simple warning/error threshold is not enough, you can write flexible
  govaluate_ expressions to calculate trigger state based on metric data.

* **Tags for triggers and subscriptions**

  When several teams/services share one monitoring tool, it is essential
  to provide some way of filtering triggers and subscriptions in the UI.
  Moira has a flexible tag system.

* **Extendable notification channels**

  Moira supports email, Slack_, Pushover_ and many other channels
  of notification out-of-the-box. But you can always write your own plugin
  in Go and rebuild Moira Notifier microservice.

* |Alarm fatigue|_ **protection**

  Sometimes one of your triggers goes mad and switches back and forth
  between states, sending you hundreds of notifications. Sometimes you
  just ignore and delete all messages, accidentally also deleting one that
  is actually important. Moira tries to protect you with a feature called
  *throttling*. It's simple: if one of your triggers starts to send over
  10 messages per hour, Moira limits this trigger to one message
  per 30 minutes. Alerts from this trigger are combined, and not lost -
  just packaged into a single message.


Limitations
-----------

By default, Moira stores metric history for one hour. This ensures
performance under heavy load. You can tweak this in config file,
but note that performance will degrade.

In order to reduce database load, Moira checks every single trigger
at most once every 5 seconds. Probably, your metrics arrive once
every minute, so you really won't notice this limitation. You can also
tweak this in config file.


.. _microservices-architecture:

Microservices
-------------

In spirit of Graphite architecture, Moira consists of several loosely
coupled microservices. You are welcome to replace or to add new ones.


Filter
^^^^^^

Filter is a lightweight service responsible for receiving lots of metric
data in Graphite format. It filters received data and saves only metrics
that match any of user triggers. This reduces load on all other parts of Moira.


Checker
^^^^^^^

Checker is an application with embedded Graphite functions. Checker watches
for incoming metric values and performs checks according to saved trigger
settings. When state of any trigger changes, Checker generates an event.


Notifier
^^^^^^^^

Notifier is an application that watches for generated events. Notifier is
responsible for scheduling and sending notifications, observing quiet hours,
retrying failed notifications, etc.


API
^^^

API is an application that serves as a backend for UI.


Web 2.0
^^^^^^^

Web 2.0 is a frontend React application, it looks like this:
