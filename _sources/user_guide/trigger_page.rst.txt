Current State and Event History

Current State

Moira shows current state, current value and time of last event
for every separate metric that matches the trigger.

Event History
-------------

On this tab you can see a chronologically sorted list of events
for each separate metric. Each event includes time, old and new
values. Please, note that the left (old) value is taken from
the previous event, and does not represent metric value just
before the event.
