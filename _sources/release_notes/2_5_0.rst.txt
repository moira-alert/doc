2.5.0
=====

Upgrading
---------

.. warning::
   This release is not compatible with Redis version below 3.2, please upgrade your Redis instance.

.. warning::
   It is not possible to upgrade from Moira 2.2 to Moira 2.5 directly. To upgrade Moira from version 2.2 or older to 2.5, please first run moira-cli |version 2.4|_ (see :ref:`important <moira-cli-2-4-0>` note).

Please update your web configuration according to the following rules:

- Add ``label`` (new required field). You can see default type and label field mappings in |default WEB UI configuration|_.
- Rename ``title`` to ``placeholder``.

See |WEB UI configuration guide|_ for more information.


Incompatible changes
--------------------

- Removed deprecated method ``PUT trigger/{{triggerId}}/maintenance``. Use ``PUT trigger/{{triggerId}}/setMaintenance`` instead (request body has not changed).
- Removed deprecated version 2.2 related conversion code. Now if you want to upgrade Moira from version 2.2 or older use moira-cli |version 2.4|_ (see important_ note).
- Fixed contact types configuration. It was hardcoded in the web UI, and now it is configurable via config file (as it should have been originally).
- Renamed the ``title`` field to more semantically correct ``placeholder`` in web UI config.
- Added a new required ``label`` field to web UI config, which is used as a contact label in web UI instead of ``type``.
- Removed ``ERROR_VALUE`` and ``WARN_VALUE`` as valid variables in expression. Old triggers with these variables will still work, but you can not update these triggers until you delete ``ERROR_VALUE`` and ``WARN_VALUE`` variables from the expression.
- Dropped support for all old browsers. Only last 2 major versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari (all mobile and desktop) and Edge (only desktop) are supported.

New features
------------

- Added Graphite tags support `#142 <https://github.com/moira-alert/moira/issues/142>`_.
- Reworked trigger search input control in web UI. Fulltext search is now available, as long as the old tag filters `#185 <https://github.com/moira-alert/moira/issues/185>`_.
- Added Webhook sender `#123 <https://github.com/moira-alert/moira/issues/123>`_. For more info see documantation_.
- Added information who and when turned on maintenance mode. You can see it as a hint in web UI near the metric, and in metric alert message `#192 <https://github.com/moira-alert/moira/issues/192>`_.
- Added a meaningful title to all Moira web pages `#177 <https://github.com/moira-alert/moira/issues/177>`_.
- Added environment variable that customizes api URL path for web UI Docker image `#173 <https://github.com/moira-alert/moira/issues/173>`_.
- Added new variables to script sender. Variable ${trigger_name} is now deprecated, removed from documentation and will be removed in the future versions of Moira `#228 <https://github.com/moira-alert/moira/issues/228>`_. For more information about new variables and script configuration see documantation_.


Bug fixes and improvements
