Feeding Metrics to Moira
========================

.. _carbon-c-relay: https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay

Moira needs to keep its own local copy of your metric data to improve
performance and reduce load on your existing graphite cluster. This means
data needs to be duplicated from your existing stream and sent to your
existing cluster and to your Moira installation.

Unfortunately, the Carbon-Relay with Graphite does not support duplication
of data to multiple backends, and so you need to use a more feature rich
carbon relay such as carbon-c-relay_.

The following is a basic example configuration which defines two clusters
and sends all metrics to both at once. One cluster is Moira installation,
and the other uses consistent hashing across a three node cluster of
Carbon servers.

   cluster moira
