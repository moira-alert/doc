Moira was originally developed and is supported by [SKB Kontur](https://kontur.ru/eng/about), a B2G company based in Ekaterinburg, Russia. We express gratitude to our company for encouraging us to opensource Moira and for giving back to the community that created [Graphite](https://graphite.readthedocs.io) and many other useful DevOps tools.
