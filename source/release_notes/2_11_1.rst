2.11.1
=====

Whatâ€™s Changed
--------------

*Major Changes*

 * Add clean up moira patterns metrics key in cli command `--cleanup-pattern-metrics`.
   Be careful using this command, it can save checker resources a lot, however it changes the default behavior of `transformNull` in Moira, 
   in fact the moment you use this command the function stops working for metrics that did not come to Moira more than `metrics_ttl`. 
   If you do a nightly cleanup in cronjob, the behavior of the function becomes similar in Graphite.
